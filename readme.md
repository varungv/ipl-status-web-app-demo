# IPL Stats application
This is a IPL Stats application built using **Django, HTML and Vanilla JS.**

The application is hosted in **Heroku** at this url: https://gale-demo.herokuapp.com/ 

The better version of this application is to convert the data coming in into **separate REST APIs** which helps optimize the application in multiple levels.
I Have created the **dockerfile** but haven't used docker image to deploy in Heroku.
